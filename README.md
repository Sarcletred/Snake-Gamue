# Snake-Gamue
🐍 Snakue Gamue by Gagana Sree
A fun little Snake Game built with Python's turtle module!
This classic arcade-style game is a great beginner-friendly project to practice Python, turtle graphics, and basic game loops.

🎮 How to Play
Use W, A, S, D keys to control the direction of the snake.

Eat the red food to grow your tail and increase your score.

Avoid hitting the wall or biting your own tail — doing so resets the game!

Your high score is tracked during your session.

🧠 Key Features
Dynamic movement using keyboard input

Score tracking with a high score display

Random food generation

Collision detection (wall and self)

Modular code structure using functions

Cute and colorful game design

💡 Notes
Snake speed is slightly slowed using a delay to make gameplay smoother.

The game runs in a continuous loop until manually closed.

All visuals are built using the standard Python turtle graphics module — no external libraries required.
